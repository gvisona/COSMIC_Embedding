# Deep Representations of Somatic Mutations in Cancer Samples

This repository describes in detail a methodology for the embedding of somatic mutations profiles in human cancer. With the development of advanced machine learning methods for precision medicine, it is increasingly important to ensure that these novel tools are made availale to researchers whose expertise does not necessarily lie in deep learning and representation learning methods. Deep learning models have the capability to integrate several data sources in a unified framework, and how this data is represented constitutes a significant portion of the experimental design involved.

The present reprository offers a complete implementation of a deep learning model for the embedding of somatic mutations profiles, as well as pre-computed embeddings for a selected set of samples from the COSMIC database, that are readily available.

The following sections describe the approach used to learn representations of cancer samples, the experimental design, and the steps necessary to use or reproduce the results.

## Dataset

The following model is trained using the [Sanger Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) database, which is a curated source of information on somatic mutations in human cancer. We are specifically interested in its vast amount of genome-wide screen data, which is a rich resource for the training of deep learning model.

More specifically, we make use of the "COSMIC Mutation Data (Genome Screens)" dataset that is available in version v92 of the project, which offers information on individual somatic mutations present in cancer samples. To reproduce the results shown in this repository, it is necessary to download and extract this dataset in the root folder of the project.

With the mutation data, we aim to encode each cancer sample as a binary vector where each component signals whether a mutation in the corresponding gene is observed. More accurately, a cancer sample is represented by two such vectors, as we follow the design choices of Palazzo et al. (2019), with which we consider deleterious and non-deleterious mutations separately.

The somatic mutations in the dataset are filtered according to the following quality control criteria:
- labelled as "Confirmed somatic variant"
- they must come from a genome-wide screen study
- mapped onto the GRCh38 reference genome
- the mutations must correspond to a gene (only coding mutations), i.e. there is an HGNC identifier available
- we exclude hypermutated samples (>1000 mutation) according to previous works in the literature (Vogelstein et al. (2013))
- underrepresented genes are removed (gene mutations that appear fewer than 100 times)

The resulting processed dataset includes 5.491.567 somatic mutations in 12.449 unique genes from 26.355 cancer samples.

## Model

The model chosen for the embedding of somatic mutation profiles is a bimodal Information-maximizing Variational Autoencoder (InfoVAE), derived from the work of Zhao et al. (2019). The structure of the model, inspired by the work of Palazzo et al. (2019), considers separately deleterious and non-deleterious mutations in the input stage. Contrary to the original work, we split the mutations into these two categories based on the FATHMM prediction (Shabib et al. (2015)) included in the COSMIC dataset.

The InfoVAE model relies om Maximum Mean Discrepancy to regularize the latent representations learned by the autoencoder model, which reportedly improves on the quality of the embeddings compared to standard VAEs.

Additionally, we implemented a beta VAE model that is closer to the original method of Palazzo et al. (2019)

We used a Beta Variational Autoencoder with warmup (SÃ¸nderby et al. (2016)), as this configuration allows the model to focus on the reconstruction of the data for the first few epochs while gradually introducting the variational objective.

## Phenotype Prediction Evaluation

To evaluate how well the learned embeddings describe the phenotype of the cancer samples, we adopted a similar approach to the work of Amar et al. (2017).

Using information from [Disease Ontology](https://disease-ontology.org/), we constructed a hierarchy of cancer subtypes, based on their site of origin and histology, which results in 56 categories. These categories were chosen so that there would be a significant enough number of samples both in the positive and negative class for each of them. If the overlap between a parent and child category was too large, we considered only the parent class.

     alt="Hierarchy of cancer subtypes"
     height=500 width=1200 />

Each cancer sample is assigned a positive (1) or negative (0) class for each category, while respecting the hierarchical structure. Some of the categories considered (e.g. adenocarcinoma) consist of purely histological subtypes, while most other categories are related to the primary site of origin of the cancer sample. Of the 26.355 samples, 25.645 were assigned at least one category, while the remaining samples were excluded from this analysis.

The embeddings analysed were obtained through the use of an InfoVAE model with latent dimension of 50, thus achieving a compression factor of 498 (12449+12449 -> 50).

We first used a UMAP projection to visualize and observe the patterns shown by the embeddings according to their categories. The plots, available in the folder "embeddings/plots_mmd_vae", show an interesting distribution of the various cancer subtypes in the embedding manifold. Interestingly, it appears that there is a concentration of "liquid tumours" in the right-hand side of the UMAP representation, while gastrointestinal and thoracic cancers are grouped mostly in the left branch.

     alt="UMAP embeddings"
     height=400 width=800 />

To evaluate how well the embeddings capture the phenotypic information of the samples, we trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each of the 56 categories to evaluate the prediction accuracy on a validation set. Given the imbalance of categories when using the full dataset, for each cancer subtype, where possible, a set of negative samples equal in size to the positive samples was randomly selected. This smaller subtype-specific dataset was split into training and test sets, and used for the classifier evaluations, by applying a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. The results reported in the following table represent the median value of the metrics across folds. 

As evidenced by the results, the compressed embeddings capture a lot of the information contained in the deleterious mutation profile, while often remaining inferior to the non-deleterious mutations profile for site identification. This suggests that, while tissue-specific mutation pattern might be more effective for site classification, it might not be the determining factor in analysing the characteristics of cancer samples. This is in-line with the paradigm shift in cancer study that prioritizes biomarker information rather than tissue-specific information.
These results do not show the same conclusion as the evaluation in the work of Palazzo et al., possibly due to the data used. While the bimodal AE architecture seems to improve the quality of the embeddings, the data in the COSMIC database contains mutational information only on those mutations that are considered deleterious in the work of Palazzo et al. (e.g. missense mutations, frame shift), while the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data used in the original study also describes synonimous mutations,
